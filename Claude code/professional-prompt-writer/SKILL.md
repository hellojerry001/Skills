# Professional Prompt Writer

Generate structured, high-quality prompts that ensure stable and professional output.

## Overview

This skill helps create two main types of prompts:

1. **Tutorial-Style Content** - Beginner-friendly educational content that corrects misconceptions or teaches proper methods
2. **Professional Instructions** - Precise, executable prompts for AI tools and professional tasks

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Prompt Type

Ask yourself what the user needs:

**Tutorial Content?**
- Teaching users how to properly use a tool/concept
- Correcting common mistakes
- Providing step-by-step guidance
- Target audience: beginners or general users

→ Use tutorial patterns (see [tutorial-patterns.md](references/tutorial-patterns.md))

**Professional Instructions?**
- Directing AI tools to complete specific tasks
- Design analysis, image generation, code creation
- Data processing or content extraction
- Target: AI systems or professional execution

→ Use professional prompt patterns (see [professional-prompts.md](references/professional-prompts.md))

### Step 2: Choose the Right Pattern

#### For Tutorial Content

**Misconception Correction Pattern:**
- Title with hook
- Introduction (reveal common mistake)
- List of misconceptions
- Insightful conclusion

**Step-by-Step Guide Pattern:**
- Title with promise
- Problem statement
- Numbered steps with rationale
- Principle-based conclusion

See detailed templates and examples in [tutorial-patterns.md](references/tutorial-patterns.md)

#### For Professional Instructions

**Design Analysis Pattern:**
- Task description
- Key elements to focus on
- Output format requirements

**Image Generation Pattern:**
- Subject description
- Style specifications
- Technical parameters

**Content Generation Pattern:**
- Task definition
- Requirements
- Format specifications
- Constraints

**Data Processing Pattern:**
- Processing action
- Focus areas
- Output format
- Additional requirements

See detailed templates and examples in [professional-prompts.md](references/professional-prompts.md)

### Step 3: Reference High-Quality Examples

Review proven examples in [examples.md](references/examples.md) to understand:
- Structural patterns that work
- Language techniques (cognitive contrast, comparisons)
- How to create impactful conclusions
- Balance between clarity and conciseness

### Step 4: Generate and Validate

After generating the prompt, validate:

**For Tutorials:**
- Does the introduction reveal a real pain point?
- Are misconceptions/steps specific and actionable?
- Does the conclusion elevate understanding?
- Is the language approachable and clear?

**For Professional Prompts:**
- Is the task objective crystal clear?
- Are all key requirements listed?
- Is terminology accurate and professional?
- Can it be executed without guessing?

## Key Principles

### 1. Structure Ensures Stability

Well-structured prompts produce consistent results. Always use clear hierarchies and logical flow.

### 2. Specificity Over Ambiguity

Be concrete. "Modern and clean" is vague. "Minimalist design with sans-serif typography and geometric shapes" is specific.

### 3. Context Matters

Different audiences need different approaches:
- Beginners: conversational, analogies, "you might think..."
- Professionals: direct, technical terms, precise requirements

### 4. Examples Beat Explanations

When possible, show rather than tell. A good example is worth paragraphs of description.
